And the next table is the summary of December's temperature statistics.  
![December](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module9-Challenge/blob/main/images/dec_df.PNG)  

According to these two tables above :
 - The average temperatures between June and December are 74.9&deg;F and 71.0&deg;F respectively, which shows that the difference between June and December is not significant.
 - Comparing the similar maximum temperature of June and December, the minimum temperatures, which are 64&deg;F and 56&deg;F respectively, have a great difference between June and December.
