# Module9-Challenge: Surfs_Up

## Project Overview 
W. Avy wants more information about temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.
## Results
### Temperature Analysis
The following two tables are the summary analysis of temperature on June (Left) and December (Right).

![December](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module9-Challenge/blob/main/images/dec_df.PNG)  

According to these two tables above :
 - The average temperatures between June and December are 74.9&deg;F and 71.0&deg;F respectively, which shows that the difference between June and December is not significant.
 - Comparing the similar maximum temperature of June and December, the minimum temperatures, which are 64&deg;F and 56&deg;F respectively, have a great difference between June and December.
### Additional Analysis on Precipitation
The following two histogram tables are the frequency of precipitation in June (Left) and December (Right).

## Summary
